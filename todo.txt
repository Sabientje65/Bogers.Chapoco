Implement publisher and cleaner as simple background services, everything should live within the same application
Track single 'active' pococha token, doesn't have to survive application reboots (extracting a new token is easy)

Worth considering, using an in-memory eventbus for communicating between API <> publisher
Could even go as far as to use an in-memory eventbus/queue for all internal messaging, likely makes everything more complicated than it needs to be though

For now, start off with direct communication lines, keep all in memory

Writable IOptions, is this a thing? If so, we can just write to our PocochaConfiguration, track an IsValid bit or w/e and react to that in our publisher? 


Add logging, file? -> rollover
